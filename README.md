# Intel oneAPI ML Hackathon
![oneAPI banner](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/develop/public/us/en/images/thumbnails/tool-thumbnail-beta-oneapi-logo.jpg)
* oneAPI is an open, cross-architecture programming model that frees developers to use a single code base across multiple architectures. The result is accelerated compute without vendor lock-in.
* The objective of this hackathon is to build solutions with oneAPI for compelling problems identified. Developers can choose to work in the themes of the ML, Computer Vision, and Open Innovation theme. The developers are expected to build the solutions using the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkits.
* The project submission must be open-source and use open-source technologies such as Scikit and Intel oneAPI; otherwise, it will not be accepted. This requirement is necessary as the project needs to be tested and evaluated during judging.
## Problem Statement
**Medical Image Analysis:** Develop computer vision projects using Scikit-Learn's image processing capabilities to analyze medical images, such as X-rays or MRI scans. This could include building models to identify patterns or anomalies that could indicate the presence of a disease or condition.

## Intel DevCloud for oneAPI
Intel provides with Cloud Services with [DevCloud](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/) to learn about oneAPI.
It provides complete code samples and training modules you can access for free for 3 months. 
## Intel oneAPI Toolkits
[Intel oneAPI Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html).
The main criteria of this hackathon is that we would **have** to use atleast one toolkit or atleast a part of it. For example one can use, Intel-optimized python, Intel-optimized Scikit-Lab.
